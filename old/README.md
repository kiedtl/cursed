# Chicago Mono

This is an old version of `cursed_font` when I first started working on
it. Back then, the only goal was to create an upscaled, monospace-ified
version of Chicago.

This version will not be updated or modified in any way, and is only kept
here for historical purposes.

Created with [fnt](https://github.com/mpu/fnt). Take my advice and stay
100 kilometers away from that monstrosity.
